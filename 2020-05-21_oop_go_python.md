## Object-Oriented Programming

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm in software development that associates
characteristics and actions with objects in the code, and which uses the actions of an
object to modify its characteristics. The characteristics of an object are called
attributes, and the actions associated with an object are called methods. This tight
structure is in contrast to procedural programming, where a variable is modified by any
function for which the variable is a valid parameter. This object structure allows for
efficient expansion
