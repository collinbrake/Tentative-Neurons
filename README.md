# Tentative Neurons
This repository holds my exploratory and educational projects involving machine learning as well as traditional algorithms like search/sort. I am especially excited about my latest project using isolation forests for anomaly detection. See the notebook `anomaly_detection_isolation_forests.ipynb` for a demonstration.
