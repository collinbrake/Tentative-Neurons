# Tentative Neurons
This repository holds my exploratory and educational projects involving machine learning as well as traditional algorithms like search/sort.

- [YOLOv3 for single class detection on OpenCV OAK-D](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DFStf-w8b1J3LA7XMOw8z4UvkSEY5B4g?usp=sharing)
- Isolation forests for anomaly detection. See the notebook [anomaly_detection_isolation_forests.ipynb](https://github.com/collinbrake/tentative-neurons/blob/master/anomaly_detection_isolation_forests.ipynb) for a demonstration.
